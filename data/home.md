## For prospective students

We are looking for self-motivated students interested in machine learning, deep learning, and Bayesian methods.
Since [Prof. Juho Lee](https://juho-lee.github.io) only can advise students at [Kim Jaechul Graduate School of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr) for now, please get admission to join us.
It is strongly recommended to contact the professor in advance (at least two or three months earlier than the graduate school admission deadline) and conduct a research project.
