Nowadays, thanks to the development of WSI(whole slide image), AI can also detect cancer.\nAS WSI is too big to fit into modern CNN architectures, it is divided into thousand of patches.\nAlso, there are only about 1000 WSI labels per dataset which easily provokes an over-fitting problem.\nOur lab focuses on multiple instance learning, where only slide-level labels are given.\nWe are trying to make pseudo-WSI labels by using information between patches. Furthermore, we are interested in self-supervised learning to extract adequate features for WSI.\nWe are also studying a reliable medical classification model based on multimodal data (MRI, natural language, omics, etc.) by applying confidence estimation through Bayesian deep learning and interpretability using explainable AI techniques.\n"}];function y(e,a,n){const t=e.slice();return t[0]=a[n],t}function w(e){let a,n,p,v,b,y,w,k,I,W,x=e[0].name+"",S=e[0].description+"";return{c(){a=t("div"),n=t("h2"),p=i(x),v=s(),b=t("p"),y=i(S),w=s(),k=t("img"),W=s(),this.h()},l(e){a=r(e,"DIV",{});var t=l(a);n=r(t,"H2",{class:!0});var i=l(n);p=o(i,x),i.forEach(c),v=d(t),b=r(t,"P",{class:!0});var s=l(b);y=o(s,S),s.forEach(c),w=d(t),k=r(t,"IMG",{src:!0,alt:!0,class:!0}),W=d(t),t.forEach(c),this.h()},h(){h(n,"class","svelte-18ll25p"),h(b,"class","svelte-18ll25p"),g(k.src,I=e[0].image||"image/dummy_wide.svg")||h(k,"src",I),h(k,"alt","..."),h(k,"class","svelte-18ll25p")},m(e,t){m(e,a,t),u(a,n),u(n,p),u(a,v),u(a,b),u(b,y),u(a,w),u(a,k),u(a,W)},p:f,d(e){e&&c(a)}}}function k(e){let a,n,i,o=b,g=[];for(let a=0;a<o.length;a+=1)g[a]=w(y(e,o,a));return{c(){a=s(),n=t("main"),i=t("div");for(let e=0;e<g.length;e+=1)g[e].c();this.h()},l(e){p('[data-svelte="svelte-2sbtyy"]',document.head).forEach(c),a=d(e),n=r(e,"MAIN",{});var t=l(n);i=r(t,"DIV",{class:!0});var s=l(i);for(let e=0;e<g.length;e+=1)g[e].l(s);s.forEach(c),t.forEach(c),this.h()},h(){document.title="SIML - Research",h(i,"class","content svelte-18ll25p")},m(e,t){m(e,a,t),m(e,n,t),u(n,i);for(let e=0;e<g.length;e+=1)g[e].m(i,null)},p(e,[a]){if(0&a){let n;for(o=b,n=0;n<o.length;n+=1){const t=y(e,o,n);g[n]?g[n].p(t,a):(g[n]=w(t),g[n].c(),g[n].m(i,null))}for(;n<g.length;n+=1)g[n].d(1);g.length=o.length}},i:f,o:f,d(e){e&&c(a),e&&c(n),v(g,e)}}}class I extends e{constructor(e){super(),a(this,e,null,k,n,{})}}export{I as default};
