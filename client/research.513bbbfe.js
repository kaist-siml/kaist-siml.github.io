Furthermore, we are interested in self-supervised learning to extract adequate features for WSI.\nWe are also studying a reliable medical classification model based on multimodal data (MRI, natural language, omics, etc.) by applying confidence estimation through Bayesian deep learning and interpretability using explainable AI techniques.\n"}];function y(e,a,n){const t=e.slice();return t[0]=a[n],t}function w(e){let a,n,p,v,b,y,w,k,I,W,x=e[0].name+"",S=e[0].description+"";return{c(){a=t("div"),n=t("h2"),p=i(x),v=s(),b=t("p"),y=i(S),w=s(),k=t("img"),W=s(),this.h()},l(e){a=r(e,"DIV",{});var t=o(a);n=r(t,"H2",{class:!0});var i=o(n);p=l(i,x),i.forEach(c),v=d(t),b=r(t,"P",{class:!0});var s=o(b);y=l(s,S),s.forEach(c),w=d(t),k=r(t,"IMG",{src:!0,alt:!0,class:!0}),W=d(t),t.forEach(c),this.h()},h(){h(n,"class","svelte-18ll25p"),h(b,"class","svelte-18ll25p"),g(k.src,I=e[0].image||"image/dummy_wide.svg")||h(k,"src",I),h(k,"alt","..."),h(k,"class","svelte-18ll25p")},m(e,t){m(e,a,t),u(a,n),u(n,p),u(a,v),u(a,b),u(b,y),u(a,w),u(a,k),u(a,W)},p:f,d(e){e&&c(a)}}}function k(e){let a,n,i,l=b,g=[];for(let a=0;a<l.length;a+=1)g[a]=w(y(e,l,a));return{c(){a=s(),n=t("main"),i=t("div");for(let e=0;e<g.length;e+=1)g[e].c();this.h()},l(e){p('[data-svelte="svelte-2sbtyy"]',document.head).forEach(c),a=d(e),n=r(e,"MAIN",{});var t=o(n);i=r(t,"DIV",{class:!0});var s=o(i);for(let e=0;e<g.length;e+=1)g[e].l(s);s.forEach(c),t.forEach(c),this.h()},h(){document.title="SIML - Research",h(i,"class","content svelte-18ll25p")},m(e,t){m(e,a,t),m(e,n,t),u(n,i);for(let e=0;e<g.length;e+=1)g[e].m(i,null)},p(e,[a]){if(0&a){let n;for(l=b,n=0;n<l.length;n+=1){const t=y(e,l,n);g[n]?g[n].p(t,a):(g[n]=w(t),g[n].c(),g[n].m(i,null))}for(;n<g.length;n+=1)g[n].d(1);g.length=l.length}},i:f,o:f,d(e){e&&c(a),e&&c(n),v(g,e)}}}class I extends e{constructor(e){super(),a(this,e,null,k,n,{})}}export{I as default};
